It's tough to beat the price as well.  My lack of 5 stars is due to the tightness of the padded upper initially.  After using my old sandals for so long, I was very used to being able to casually throw them on and walk out the door.  However these were too tight for the first couple of weeks, and after one day my feet were very tender on top due to the padding.  I don't have particularly large feet, so I imagine this would be a problem with other sizes as well.Overall though, these are great casual sandals to wear just about anywhere.  Traction is good, though I would expect that to wear away with further use in future years.\",\n",

I was very satisfied with that sandal and wanted to purchase a similar Nike sandal. First of all after opening the box and trying on these sandals I discovered that this sandal is at least 1/2-1 size small, i.e. I ordered a mens\\' size 11, my actual foot size is exactly 10.5, and this sandal just barely fits with no exposed edge left whatsoever in the entire sandal (and I\\'m close to my ideal body weight, not overweight at all). Next it\\'s made of a comparatively thinner polymer material that provides minimal cushioning to absorb shocks. My older sandal had a much thicker sole with a thick tread pattern for non-slip walking, and had a form fitted arch so that my foot neatly fitted into it without slipping when walking, etc. This sandal has none of those good design properties: its sole is much thinner in comparison with minimal arch support; and the tread pattern is comprised of relatively small ridges that do not appear to be thick enough to prevent slipping on wet hard surfaces.Also as another reviewer mentioned the underside of the front support is a fabric-like material that absorbs moisture like crazy so no wonder he said they smelled \"funky\" after a short time..this material if it stays wet is expected to be subject to mold growth.Btm line: save your $ and don\\'t buy this sandal, especially if you\\'ve owned similar older Nike sandals. I\\'m keeping these but will only use them at the gym in the locker shower room which is the intended purpose, but what a disappointment! I\\'m keeping my older Nike sandals which although they are worn, they are vastly superior design and quality-wise.',\n",

I was a little apprehensive of purchasing these at first because they are men's sizing only, and women's sandals didn't compare to these at all and were even a little more pricier. I am a size 7 in Women's and went ahead and ordered the size 6 in men's. I have no complaints because I appreciate the extra half inch my toes now have. The fit was a little tight but within about 20 minutes of wearing they stretched to become quite comfortable. I haven't started my track season yet but I will definitely use these sandals as a pre/post choice to wear, because they look nice and feel amazing. And, considerably durable. Overall, I would recommend to anyone who wants a simple but clean style and comfortable wear.\",\n",

It says they can be used for taking a shower in the description, but I wouldn't recommend doing so because of the foam.  I just wear them around the house and they are comfortable.

However, just because they are Nike, doesn't mean they are the best quality. On the heel of the sandals, the rubber seemed wrinkled and didn't look good, but the people I bought them from want a restocking fee and return shipping to be paid by the buyer, which was more than the actual product, so I decided to not pay twice for something I wasn't going to keep. Also, near my toes they started to tear on the left foot. I think I just got the bad egg of the dozen, but I think I might get something better next time.\",\n",

I tried going back to double check my order but ended up being told I now purchased 2 orders.  I closed my order for the second purchase as I only wanted one pair and figured I did order the first pair since you took my credit card # and all.  The order never arrived so I ordered it again but size # 16 kept showing up and I couldn't change it so I again assumed it was code for # 8.  I payed extra money to have it shipped in two days.  It came on time but the sliders were a size 16 and much too big for my grandson.I tried to get the paperwork to send them back but you wouldn't accept my password; the same password you accepted for the sale.I think you need a much friendlier service for ordering..I will never,ever order another thing from Amazon.com\",\n",

I wear a size 10 in pretty much every show I own (even other Nike shoes), but the size 10 I ordered in these just do not fit well.  The strap isn't high enough to leave room for your foot, so you almost have to squeeze them on every time rather than them just sliding on.

Sometimes I think working at Neiman may have doomed me to forever be overly picky! :pI\\'ve been shopping for shoes for months, & so glad I found this. I luv that it\\'s not overly \"sporty\" looking...it has a nice material & classic lines. Also love that the thong is flat, not round...this should prevent getting blisters at the beginning of each Summer. Most important, they are SO comfy for a flip flop....they\\'ve got a little \"cush!\" While they don\\'t exactly have arch support, it\\'s rare to find a basic flip flop with that...but these should be great for everyday errands that require a lot of walking (especially where my back would hurt after a lot of walking on hard floors from other flip flops). If I find they work for my major walking days, I may have to get another pair!',\n",

They are about 1.5-2 years old, look brand new and still are very comfortable.  BUT, the inside sole turns the bottoms of my feet BLACK!!  I have to scrub to get the black off.  I'm guessing that the rubber is deteriorating or breaking down in some manner, which must be causing this.  Nike tried to tell me these were made in 2008 ... if so, that's not when *I* bought them and would do nothing about this.  I used to wear $3 thongs (certainly not as comfortable) but they have NEVER broken down and discolored my feet! Very disappointing coming from Nike - a $25 Nike thong sandal shouldn't ever cause discoloration of your feet!\",\n",

So I went searching for an all white pair of runners and found these beauties!  At first wear, I didn't know if I was going to like them, as they were tight and constrictive and very narrow towards the front.  They do require a wear in period (about 3 days of solid wear), and the leather softens up to your foot and from that point on they are super comfortable.  No more headaches at the end of the day from the impact my feet take running about the ship and they breathe really well so my feet don't stink either.  Great purchase and I'm glad I got them.\",\n",

For a sneakers that price for a 5 year old I do expect to get value for money expecially since the air force one he wore for the entire year last year is still in good condition except that they dont fit him anymore.

Or at least the pair i received was. if you dont know what a B grade is it is a shoe that was made by nike but in the factory when they made it it was not perfect. There was one little flaw. instead of tossing the pair nike finds somewhere to sell it besides one of there stores such as this amazon seller. The shoes fit fine there are no flaws to prove that they are replicas (fakes) but there is a clear flaw that is just a factory mistake by nike. I would post a picture if i could and you would see what i mean. When the shoes are on your feet and you look down at them right where the tip of the nike swoosh is (side closest to the toe of the shoe) there is a kind of curve in the charcol part that follows the curv. on one shoe the curv is perfect and pointed at the end like the nike swoosh but on the other shoe it is rounded and dosent have that same point. it is just a clear poor mistake by nike because if they were replicas these would be the best replicas ever made. Besides that they are some cool kicks but i wouldnt pay the full price for them if they are B grades. I would suggest buying them elsewhere. I am the only one who notices it but i feel like i was cheated of some of the money i spent on them. there very comfortable and i will still wear them till they wear out. you could still buy them but fully inspect the shoe before wearing them because once u wear them u are stuck with them they can not be refunded.',\n",

They are cushy how I like for squats.  The thing I don't like it that the tongue is nylon.  I hate the Cortez nylons as they are cheesy and prefer my shoes to be leather as they last longer look better and are more comfy better made.  Nylon is just a cheap material so I avoid it as much as possible as a rule.  Nike made these Cortez cheaper than their other Cortez.  Cortez is like a tough shoe like Lugz.  Now Nike makes weird shoes with silly colors so harder to get a decent shoe out of them.  I have been looking for the Cortez blue suedes for a long time like four years and have not been able to find them, only the leathers and nylons and this one is a cross of both so that is disappointing.  I wanted to put fat laces on these but with the cheapo nylon inside that seems silly.  Who puts fat laces on nylons?  I probably will but leather tongue is more comfortable plus I plan on running a lot on these and leather is not as absorbent as nylon.  The nylon is going to get funky quick with my demanding workouts.  I guess I'm better off with track Asics and Adidas as it seems Nike is lowering their quality putting brand recognition over quality materials and construction.  Nike leather is cheap and thin and then they try to piece pleather of fabric in places to be even cheaper.  They are too greedy and as a result they are hurting their brand.  I bought four other shoes and I am sure they are all better than this one such as the PUMA Men's Roma Basic Lace-Up Fashion Sneaker.\",\n",

              "  'reviewText': 'Looking around on amazon.com I found a product that I think is overrated. The Nike air max 2013, these shoes are the running shoes you see everybody wearing. Ads call them the new hot swagger if super stars got them why don\\'t you. So many people fall for these Ads, but me ii think this product has a problem with it time span, all the different color, there\\'s so many more problem with the shoe. The product has some good qualities but the shoe its self is just ugly for the price there sold for in all stores. These shoes are over priced at $200 a pair. This is my negative review about this product \"THE PRICE\".The prices for the Nike air max 2013 I think are overpriced. Why they cost so much is because of the product description, the Nike air max 2013 running shoes are the most flexible of its kind. People say when they go running the shoe is so flexible it fills as if there were no shoes on their feet. The shoe is so lightweight its 1.5 weight makes it fill as if you could run forever. I also think the prices for the Nike air max cost so much money is because of how comfortable the shoe is to the users.The shoe immediately out of the box looked cheap and seemed poorly made. The style of the shoe looks like it\\'s not made to least still it\\'s one of the best of its kind. People all over the world buys the Nike air max 2013 for running and running only it\\'s understandable why, the shoe is great for running but the shoe is way too ugly to cost over $200. I think people would buy this shoe just cause of the ethos super stars put on about the shoe, cause to me the shoe is not all that great but like I said the shoe do have good quality use for athletes of all kind.',\n",

Something about walking on a bubble of air always fascinated me. But this year I think Nike missed the mark. The most obvious change is to the tongue of the shoe. Or whatever this thing is called. It's extremely thin made of some type of nylon. Reminds me of the same material rain jackets are made of. It's so thin I have doubts it will last very long. Its like a flap of fabric, no cushion to it at all. The tongue is so thin and small that I have a hard time grabbing the thing when pulling them on me feet.  I typically buy new Nike once a year. But the feel of these shoes does not instill confidence in me that they will make the entire year. Maybe it's just me. But I feel prior versions were made of better material. I will keep them simply because I need new shoes. But if I had seen these in the store before I made my purchase online, I probably would have chosen a different year model. Don't get me wrong, they are still Nike Air max. And if you wear Nike as much as I wear Nike,  then they will do just fine. I just don't like them compared to prior versions and I think the tongue is a cheap thin piece of ----. That's my two cents. Still a good shoe.\",\n",

And after going to the stores and trying on countless different pairs, this was by far the most comfortable shoe I have ever wore.  I bought them immediately after trying them on and walking a little bit in them.  I know this is not a cheap shoe, so if you are on a strict budget, this might not be for you.  But if you are les concerned with price and more concerned with comfort, this shoe is for you.  I am planning on buying a second pair here on Amazon within a week or two.',\n",

I was very satisfied with that sandal and wanted to purchase a similar Nike sandal. First of all after opening the box and trying on these sandals I discovered that this sandal is at least 1/2-1 size small, i.e. I ordered a mens\\' size 11, my actual foot size is exactly 10.5, and this sandal just barely fits with no exposed edge left whatsoever in the entire sandal (and I\\'m close to my ideal body weight, not overweight at all). Next it\\'s made of a comparatively thinner polymer material that provides minimal cushioning to absorb shocks. My older sandal had a much thicker sole with a thick tread pattern for non-slip walking, and had a form fitted arch so that my foot neatly fitted into it without slipping when walking, etc. This sandal has none of those good design properties: its sole is much thinner in comparison with minimal arch support; and the tread pattern is comprised of relatively small ridges that do not appear to be thick enough to prevent slipping on wet hard surfaces.Also as another reviewer mentioned the underside of the front support is a fabric-like material that absorbs moisture like crazy so no wonder he said they smelled \"funky\" after a short time..this material if it stays wet is expected to be subject to mold growth.Btm line: save your $ and don\\'t buy this sandal, especially if you\\'ve owned similar older Nike sandals. I\\'m keeping these but will only use them at the gym in the locker shower room which is the intended purpose, but what a disappointment!

I have a feeling it absorbs sweat quite well and would probably start to smell bad after a while. It says they can be used for taking a shower in the description, but I wouldn't recommend doing so because of the foam.  I just wear them around the house and they are comfortable.

The shoes fit fine there are no flaws to prove that they are replicas (fakes) but there is a clear flaw that is just a factory mistake by nike. I would post a picture if i could and you would see what i mean. When the shoes are on your feet and you look down at them right where the tip of the nike swoosh is (side closest to the toe of the shoe) there is a kind of curve in the charcol part that follows the curv. on one shoe the curv is perfect and pointed at the end like the nike swoosh but on the other shoe it is rounded and dosent have that same point. it is just a clear poor mistake by nike because if they were replicas these would be the best replicas ever made. Besides that they are some cool kicks but i wouldnt pay the full price for them if they are B grades. I would suggest buying them elsewhere. I am the only one who notices it but i feel like i was cheated of some of the money i spent on them. there very comfortable and i will still wear them till they wear out. you could still buy them but fully inspect the shoe before wearing them because once u wear them u are stuck with them they can not be refunded.',\n",

Nylon is just a cheap material so I avoid it as much as possible as a rule.  Nike made these Cortez cheaper than their other Cortez.  Cortez is like a tough shoe like Lugz.  Now Nike makes weird shoes with silly colors so harder to get a decent shoe out of them.  I have been looking for the Cortez blue suedes for a long time like four years and have not been able to find them, only the leathers and nylons and this one is a cross of both so that is disappointing.  I wanted to put fat laces on these but with the cheapo nylon inside that seems silly.  Who puts fat laces on nylons?  I probably will but leather tongue is more comfortable plus I plan on running a lot on these and leather is not as absorbent as nylon.  The nylon is going to get funky quick with my demanding workouts.  I guess I'm better off with track Asics and Adidas as it seems Nike is lowering their quality putting brand recognition over quality materials and construction.  Nike leather is cheap and thin and then they try to piece pleather of fabric in places to be even cheaper.  They are too greedy and as a result they are hurting their brand.

Ads call them the new hot swagger if super stars got them why don\\'t you. So many people fall for these Ads, but me ii think this product has a problem with it time span, all the different color, there\\'s so many more problem with the shoe. The product has some good qualities but the shoe its self is just ugly for the price there sold for in all stores. These shoes are over priced at $200 a pair. This is my negative review about this product \"THE PRICE\".The prices for the Nike air max 2013 I think are overpriced. Why they cost so much is because of the product description, the Nike air max 2013 running shoes are the most flexible of its kind. People say when they go running the shoe is so flexible it fills as if there were no shoes on their feet. The shoe is so lightweight its 1.5 weight makes it fill as if you could run forever. I also think the prices for the Nike air max cost so much money is because of how comfortable the shoe is to the users.The shoe immediately out of the box looked cheap and seemed poorly made. The style of the shoe looks like it\\'s not made to least still it\\'s one of the best of its kind. People all over the world buys the Nike air max 2013 for running and running only it\\'s understandable why, the shoe is great for running but the shoe is way too ugly to cost over $200. I think people would buy this shoe just cause of the ethos super stars put on about the shoe, cause to me the shoe is not all that great but like I said the shoe do have good quality use for athletes of all kind.',\n",

Something about walking on a bubble of air always fascinated me. But this year I think Nike missed the mark. The most obvious change is to the tongue of the shoe. Or whatever this thing is called. It's extremely thin made of some type of nylon. Reminds me of the same material rain jackets are made of. It's so thin I have doubts it will last very long. Its like a flap of fabric, no cushion to it at all. The tongue is so thin and small that I have a hard time grabbing the thing when pulling them on me feet.  I typically buy new Nike once a year. But the feel of these shoes does not instill confidence in me that they will make the entire year. Maybe it's just me. But I feel prior versions were made of better material. I will keep them simply because I need new shoes. But if I had seen these in the store before I made my purchase online, I probably would have chosen a different year model. Don't get me wrong, they are still Nike Air max. And if you wear Nike as much as I wear Nike,  then they will do just fine. I just don't like them compared to prior versions and I think the tongue is a cheap thin piece of ----. That's my two cents. Still a good shoe.\",\n",

They last 9 months to a year of almost daily use.  They have a very stiff sole which gives you the support you need while running or walking.  Test your shoes by trying to bend them in half.  If they bend, that means there is very little support and your foot isn't suppose to bend that way.  These Nikes never bend and are super firm.  Run on my friends.  Run on.\",\n",
